>> Sarah: Here is where you would start from and here is this and then in the solution we have filters. I am just using switch statements to decide whether it goes to first, second, third and most of them are this default of [SOUND] [LAUGH] and that is what gets outputted there, and that view directive for the color is super simple, it's view dot directive color, passing in the EL and the binding to change this and the thing to note here is that it's going to have to be a string value, that red or that hex value.
