>> Sarah Drasner: Okay, so exercise time. You are going to take this pen, here, and this pen is hard-coded. It has your upcoming destinations. It has a little SVG here. It has this h2, and it has some text. And it's all just hard-coded here. But in your view instance, you have all of these locations in an array, Paris, and an image, and a description.
