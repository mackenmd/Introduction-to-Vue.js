>> Sarah: We do have an exercise, but I'm not sure if we have time to do it. You might wanna try it out later because me just lecturing at you and showing you code is probably not going to be the same thing as actually trying to use it. So we, what we have is this comment form problem in the repo.

[00:00:21]
So let's go look at that very quickly. You can maybe do this on your own time. And we have,
>> Sarah: We have that simple common form that we had before. And this isn't like a good use case for ViewX but it's good practice if we open it up.

[00:00:59]
I'm wondering if we just go right [LAUGH] to the solution for this. Maybe we look at this really quickly and then going into the solution. We don't have a store we haven't added that yet. So your task would be to add a store and we have that individual comment.

[00:01:17]
And we would basically wanna change all of the, adding the comments and pushing the comments to be, mutations and have all of these comments actually live as the state in our store. So we would do all of this logic of owning this state, and then pushing the comments.

[00:01:41]
So owning the state in the store and then creating a mutation in the store in order to create these new comments
